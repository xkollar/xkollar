Colour. Is it? Not everyone thinks so. Maybe the only one there is.

It used to black. Well trained eye could have seen whole spectrum in black.
Black is still nice but somehow grey seems more appropriate. Grey it is not new
black. It never will be. It never could. It is grey after all. Neutral. Without
emotion. Safe. Soothing. Protecting… One can dissolve themselves within grey.
Their identity. Fears. Hopes. Assumptions. Ideas. Intelligence. Ego. Sexuality.
Desires. Emotions. Pain…

Accept grey and become undistinguishable part of environment, almost cease to
be, at least for all intents and purposes. There is no mystery, there is no
light. Just grey nothing. If nothing had a colour, it would be grey. It is so
tempting to become part of nothing. Elusive. Too good to be true.

Colour of unimportant. All grey mice living their lives in the traps of
cubicles, dreaming of all colours of cheese. Boring? One does not care. One has
accepted grey.

Grey is the colour of city sky. Beautiful. If you like that kind of thing.
One does. The only one that makes sense, that is true, unpretending.

Colour of being alone, even when surrounded by others. Ultimate hideout when
no-one dares to follow, neither friends, nor foes. Emotional desert, where only
nomads dare to go and they know better than interrupting each other's solitude.
They know grey.

Colour of minimal energy. White being energetic, overpowering. Grey is not that
wasteful, yet it reveals enough so it can be seen that there is nothing, unlike
pitch black. It is truly colour of death. Neither black, mysterious and
promising, nor white, inviting and pure. Just realistic grey of acceptance.

One used to believe eyes can not be grey. One was mistaken.
